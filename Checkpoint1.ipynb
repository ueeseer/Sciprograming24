    "## Checkpoint 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim \n",
    "\n",
    "To write a basic `Python` program to prompt for a floating point number, read it in, perform basic arithmetic and print out the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a `Python` program to calculate and output the radius and surface area of a sphere from its volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt for the volume of a sphere in $mm^3$.\n",
    "2. Calculate and print out to the terminal the radius and the surface area of the sphere in m and $m^2$ respectively in an understandable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your program works for a range of volumes, both large and small and that you have the output units correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this checkpoint you need to have read and studied the following course sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Basic Variables](../CourseNotes/variables.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Printing and Reading to/from the terminal](../CourseNotes/terminalIO.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Adding Mathematical Functions](../CourseNotes/functions.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check carefully that you have fullfilled at least the assessement criteria below. Call a demonstrator, show them your code, and run your program with the following input volumes:\n",
    "    - $$ 1.4 \\times 10^6 \\text{ mm}^3 $$\n",
    "    - $$ 3.7 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mm}^3 $$\n",
    "- Ensure that the demonstrator finds you in Learn. Please check that your pass/fail (0/1) has been entered correctly (you should be able to see this in Learn). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this checkpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program works for the supplied numbers, *including* correct powers of 10. \n",
    "- Prompting is sensible and the output is clear.\n",
    "- Variable names are concise, but explain their purpose, and there are basic commenets explaining the operation of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed this checkpoint, please continue with the [Week1](../WeeklyTasks/Week1.ipynb) tasklist."
