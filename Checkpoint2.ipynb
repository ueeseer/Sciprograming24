    "## Checkpoint 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a Python program to read in the coefficients of a quadratic equation and print out the roots for all conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program demonstrates how to use a simple function, the use of conditional statements, mainly the `if : elif : else:` construct, and how to deal with the various input conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program to read in the three floating point coefficients a, b and c of the quadratic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a x^2 + b x + c = 0$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "then calculate and display the roots using the standard formula for roots of a quadratic equation, being :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_i = \\frac{ −b± \\sqrt{b^2−4ac}}{2a} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is expected to deal with conditions of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. two real roots\n",
    "2. two complex roots\n",
    "3. single real root\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program must contain a function to calculate the discriminant, $d=b^2−4ac$ and must have a main(): method. All variables must be declared inside a function or main(). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the sections for Checkpoint 1, you will need to have read and studied the following additional sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Basic Functions](../CourseNotes/basicfunctions.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Conditionals](../CourseNotes/conditionalstatements.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the structure of this program is more complex than it initially looks; plan out what you are going to do before you start coding and also check it a bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check your program with the following values:\n",
    "    - a=2.0, b=4.0 and c=−8.0\n",
    "    - a=2.0, b=−4.0 and c=8.0\n",
    "    - a=2.0, b=4.0 and c=2.0\n",
    "    - a=0.0, b=6.0 and c=8.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you get sensible answers for the four cases. **Remember when a=0.0 you will get a linear equation with a single root. You should handle this correctly.**\n",
    "> #### Note:\n",
    "> You should think about using the `cmath.sqrt` and `math.sqrt` functions to deal explicitly with square roots of complex and real numbers respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call a demonstrator, show them your code and run your program with the four sets of inputs above and any additional ones requested by the demonstrator.\n",
    "- Ensure that the demonstrator finds you in Learn. Please check that your pass/fail (0/1) has been entered correctly (you should be able to see this in Learn). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass this checkpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program must work correctly for at least three of the above four cases.\n",
    "- The prompting is sensible.\n",
    "- The code structure uses a function to calculate the discriminant and has a main(): function.\n",
    "- The code uses conditional statements `(if : elif : else:)` to test for the various cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "Once you have completed this checkpoint, please continue with the [Week2](../WeeklyTasks/Week2.ipynb) tasklist."
